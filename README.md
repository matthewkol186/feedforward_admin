# FeedForward Admin Console
A dashboard intended to be used by Second Harvest Food Bank's Nutrition Department to deploy and analyze client-targeted surveys. Built in AngularJS, Angular Material, and Firebase.

## Changes for Backend Demo Day
Implemented Firebase in siteService.js and surveyService.js. Also implemented the ability to delete and copy surveys. Finally, we also added the ability to deploy a survey to a new site as well as deactivate/activate surveys. (Also, by way of Firebase, any new survey entries automatically show up in the page without a need to refresh! Radical!)
